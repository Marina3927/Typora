# Discover the Science Within

## CHAPTER 1 Psychology as a Science 

Thinking Like a Researcher

#### Why Research Methods Are Important: Thinking Differently

#### Natural Flaws in Thinking

**availability heuristic** 

a mental shortcut strategy for judging the likelihood of an event or situation occurring based on how easily we can think of similar or relevant instances.

**representativeness heuristic** 

a mental shortcut strategy for determining the likelihood of an event by how much it resembles what we consider to be a “typical” example of that event.

**better-than-average effect** 

the tendency to overestimate our skills, abilities, and performance when comparing ourselves to others. 

**overconfidence phenomenon** 

the tendency to be overly confident in the correctness of our own judgments. 

**hindsight bias** 

a sense that we “knew it all along” after we learn the actual outcome. 

**confirmation bias** 

a bias in which we only look for evidence that confirms what we already believe, thereby strengthening the original belief. 

**focusing effect** 

a bias in which we emphasize some pieces of information while undervaluing other pieces. 

**introspection** 

reflecting on our own thoughts and experiences to find relevant evidence. 

**“what you see is all there is” phenomenon** 

a failure to see the limitations of our immediate experience, making it difficult to predict alternative outcomes. 

**pleasure paradox** 

when an introspective analysis regarding a positive experience results in it becoming less enjoyable. 

**belief perseverance** 

maintaining a belief despite encountering contradictory factual information; often accomplished by interpreting information in a way that does not invalidate the original belief.

#### Anecdotal Versus Scientific Evidence

Nassim Taleb

“We love the tangible, the confirmation, the palpable, the real, the visible, the concrete, the known, the seen, the vivid, the visual . . . In other words, we are naturally shallow and superficial — and we do not know it”

**law of small numbers** 

extreme outcomes are more likely when considering a small number of cases. 

**outlier** 

a case or instance that is distinct from the majority of other cases; an oddball.

#### Need for Scientific Reasoning

sabermetrics

mechanical prediction was the superior method for providing higher-quality diagnoses than clinical method

**scientific method** 

a systematic approach for addressing questions of interest.

### Goals of the Scientific Method

#### Producing Basic and Applied Research

Basic research often serves as the foundation for **applied research**, which usually has a more immediate goal of solving a practical problem or examining the real-world implications of a particular theory.

**basic research** 

research dedicated to expanding the existing knowledge on a topic. 

**applied research** 

research dedicated to solving a problem and helping people by improving their quality of life. 

#### Becoming Better Consumers of Research

**pseudoscience** 

claims or beliefs that are misrepresented as being derived from the use of the scientific method.

#### Acquiring Career Skills

#### Project Management

Researchers need to be detail-oriented, paying attention to the nuances of the study that will ensure its methodological soundness.

#### Problem Solving

#### Critical Thinking

**critical-thinking skills** 

the process of actively evaluating, applying, analyzing, and synthesizing information. 

#### Analytical Skills

#### Interpretation of Numerical Information

**infographic** 

a graphic that synthesizes statistical information with aesthetically appealing visuals.

#### Communication Skills

### Final Thoughts

Learning about research will stimulate your curiosity about the world around you. As William Butler Yeats said, “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”

## Chapter 2 The Research Process

Ideas to Innovations

### Something to Think Sbout

scientifically literate

the scientific method represents a set of general steps for systematically answering questions

“Asking questions is a good way to find things out.” 

#### The Research Question 

-  should feel a special connection to your research idea
- **empirical** in nature (an approach in which the experimenter uses direct and indirect observations or experiences to test the research question)

i.e. “What gives meaning to a person’s life?”

#### The Literature Search

**peer review** (ask sound research questions, use suitable methods to test possible answers, draw appropriate conclusions)

the process by which other scientific experts in the field review and evaluate the quality of research before it is reported in a publication.

#### Constructing a Hypothesis

**hypothesis**

an educated prediction that provides a testable explanation of a phenomenon. 

**scientific law** 

a statement based on repeated experimental observation that describes some aspect of the world

##### Weber’s law of just noticeable difference

**scientific theory** 

a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world confirmed through repeated observation and experimentation

surmise the hypothesis (guess)

#### Generating Hypotheses

Introspection

find **the exception to the rule**

a matter of degree

change the directionality

#### Evaluating Hypotheses

- a high correpondence with reality

- simple amd direct
- parsimony (parsimonious) --- extremely unwilling to spend money

##### **Occam’s razor** 

refers to the cutting away of the unnecessary; important in hypothesis development; named after William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher

-  falsifiable or refutable ---

##### **Barnum effect** (Believing sth. broad, vague is part of human instincts.)

the tendency of people to believe that general descriptions of their personality are highly accurate and tailored specifically for them. 

### Testing Your Hypothesis

choose the appropriate methods

#### Identify Key Variables

**variable**

elements that we expect to change or vary, or that can have several different values. 

**constant** 

a factor that does not change and remains consistent. 

**conceptual definition** 

defining a variable in theoretical terms. 

**operational definition** 

determining how we will use variables in our study

#### Choose a Research Design

1 ex | non-ex

##### **experimental design** 

a research method in which the experimenter controls and manipulates the independent variable, allowing the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships between the independent and dependent variables. 

**independent variable (IV)** (introduces or inputs)

the variable that influences the dependent variable. In experiments the researcher manipulates or controls this variable. In nonexperimental studies, it is the explanatory or predictor variable and is not manipulated by the researcher. 

**dependent variable (DV)** 

the variable measured in association with changes in the independent variable; the outcome or effect. In nonexperimental studies it is referred to as the criterion or response variable.

##### **nonexperimental design** 

(not sure which variable causes which;  cannot manipulate the independent variable for ethical or pragmatic reasons.)

a design in which there is no control or manipulation of the independent variable; cause-and-effect relationships between variables cannot be established; refer to the independent variable as the explanatory or predictor variable and the dependent variable as the criterion or response variable; also known as a correlational design. 

**explanatory (predictor) variable** 

a potential causal variable in nonexperimental designs; also known as a predictor variable. 

**criterion (response) variable** 

the outcome variable in nonexperimental designs; also known as a response variable. 

**levels** 

different variations of the independent variable determined by the researcher. 

2  narrow down your design choice

**between-subjects design** 

a data collection method in which each participant or subject is only assessed on the dependent variable once.

**within-subjects design** 

a data collection method in which each participant or subject is assessed on the dependent variable more than once. 

**longitudinal design** 

the collection of data on participants over a set period of time

**programmatic research** (i.e. non+exp)

a systematic and planned sequence of related studies where subsequent studies build directly on a previous study’s findings to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon. 

#### Open Science Practices

**open science** 

the practice of freely sharing our scientific work along all stages of the research process.

#### Conduct the Study

**research protocol** 

a detailed series of steps that describes the order in which to administer the study and provides a script of what the researcher should say and do. 

**script** (in research protocol)

a written set of instructions that the researcher reads to the participant while collecting data. 

**informed consent**

a part of standard ethical procedures at the beginning of a research study in which the participant learns about the expectations of the study, is told the risks and benefits of participating, and then freely makes the choice about whether he or she wants to be in the study. 

**debriefing** 

a part of standard ethical procedures at the end of a research study; contains an explanation of the purpose of the study and disclosure of deception, and gives participants a chance to ask questions

#### Analyze the Data and Draw Conclusions

**data** 

distinct pieces of information

#### Communicate the Findings

**research poster** 

a formal visual research presentation. 

**paper presentation** 

a formal oral research presentation explaining key features of the study and the results

**APA style** 

a format for writing a research report, addressing both content and formatting, that was established by the American Psychological Association and that psychology and many other social sciences use. 

**APA Publication Manual** 

a publication of the American Psychological Association that details how to write research reports in APA style. 

#### Overview Sections of APA Style

**title page** 

the first page of an APA-style report that identifies the title of the work as well as the authors and their institutional affiliations. 

**abstract** 

a short summary of an entire research report that addresses the research topic, methodology used, findings, and conclusions. 

**introduction** 

the portion of an APA-style research report that provides background literature on the topic under investigation, as well as a justification of importance for the work and the hypotheses

**method** 

the portion of an APA-style research report in which the researcher provides details about the sample, materials, and procedure of collecting data

**results** 

the portion of an APA-style research report that provides information about how the hypotheses were tested, explaining through statistical language, narrative, and reference to tables and graphs.

**discussion** 

the portion of an APA-style research report in which the researcher interprets, explains, and applies the results of the study. Weakness

**reference page** 

the part of an APA-style research report in which referenced literary works are given credit.

#### Publish the Findings

**research journal** 

a periodical containing articles by experts in a particular field of study

The more you learn about how to conduct research yourself, the better you will be at consuming scientific information from mass media sources, and basing life choices on it. 

## Lecture 2. 0516

Scientists don't care about prescription (value, worldview), but description.

Positive is a value-laden (heavily loaded with sth.) word.

Peer Review's cons: Experts may have their paradigms. Your research may contradict with their paradigms.

Hypothesis: specfic

Scientific Law

Scientific Theory: understand the phenomena, general

## Lecture 3. 0518

operationalize the same conceptual variable

What / Why

#### C3 handout

Ethics are a set of (universal #Kant /relative) principles that people in society agree to comply with. There may be incompatibility between 2 ethical rules. Interest

In Q1's situation, equity and justice (responsibility/right) are prior to friendship. Although you may not feel comfortable reporting your friend to the professor, you should do it. If you don't report, all students may suspect each other.

Many people think of morality as something that’s personal and normative, whereas ethics is the standards of “good and bad” distinguished by a certain community or social setting... By these definitions of the terms, your *morality* would contradict the *ethics* of your community.

## Chapter 3 Ethics

Making Ethical Decisions in Research

### Something to Think About

Ideas + practical

Whether there should be limits on how far scientists can go in their pursuit of knowledge.

### What Are Ethics? 

**ethics** 

the application of moral principles to help guide one’s decisions and behavior.

How could utilitarianism (do the greatest good for the greatest number of people), altruism (helping without personal benefit) , and egoism (acting in accordance with one’s own self-interest) apply to a psychologist’s research process? 

### Important Ethical Principles---5

##### Principle 1: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence (Belmont)

**cost-benefit analysis** 

an ethical principle of research in which a researcher weighs all the potential and known benefits against all the potential and known risks before conducting a study. 

**beneficence** 

actively promoting the welfare of others; an ethical obligation to maximize benefits in research studies. 

**nonmaleficence** 

do no harm; an ethical obligation to mitigate or eliminate risks to study participants. 

**loss of confidentiality** 

a failure to protect the privacy of individuals; a potential risk to participants. 

**anonymity** (harder to assure than confidentiality)

a guarantee in research studies that individual responses cannot be linked back to individual participants

**physical harm** 

a physical toll that study participation may have; a potential risk to participants

**psychological harm** 

a psychological toll that study participation may have such as stress, negative emotions, or loss of self-esteem; a potential risk to participants. 

**cost of not doing the research** 

considering the potential beneficial application of study findings when doing a cost- benefit analysis (stress <  develop new treatments for phobias)

##### Principle 2: Justice

**justice** 

fairness in selecting study participants and in determining which participants receive the benefits of participation and which bear the burden of risk. 

##### Principle 3: Respect for Persons 

**autonomy** 

freely making an informed decision about participation in research

**assent** 

an active affirmation of a desire to participate from a person who does not have the ability to consent themselves; consent must also be sought from the legal guardian. 

#### Ethics Through a Historical Lens

- The types of studies and techniques they were using were so new that the scientists were not able to fully consider the ramifications of their actions

- There is also an inclination to think, "Certainly, modern-day scientists know better and would never do anything like that.”

be more creative and ingenious in how we design our studies

A research should undergo an ethical review before data collection started.

### Putting Ethics Into Practice

#### Making Ethical Decisions About Your Study 

**confederate** 

an accomplice of the experimenter. 

So while we may not be able to study bullying directly, we can study social rejection, which is one component of bullying;  said nice or gossiped about them

#### Conducting Your Study Ethically 

providing an environment in which people can freely choose to participate

To ensure natural reactions from our participants, we will provide a cover story.

As a result of the deception (intentionally misleading participants in some fashion) and potential for distress, we need a thorough debriefing.

##### The Institutional Review Board IRB p248

a board that reviews the ethical merit of all the human research conducted at an institution. 

##### The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee

a board that reviews the ethical merit and research procedures for all animal research conducted within an institution and ensures research animals have proper living conditions

### Scientific Integrity

uphold a high degree of **scientific integrity****

**scientific integrity** 

a commitment to intellectual honesty and adherence to ethical principles in scientific research.

#### The Ethical Treatment of Data 

p256

#### The Ethical Presentation of Findings

Superposition of Forces ($R=$ the net force acting on a body=single force)

media outlets seeking to make a study’s findings as provocative as possible; 

when someone mislabels an axis on a figure or diagram by not starting the scale on the y-axis at zero; scale the data

**file drawer problem** 

a bias in the scientific community to only publish findings that confirm a researcher’s hypothesis

**plagiarism** 

representing others’ work or ideas as our own, or without giving proper credit. 

**paraphrase** 

summarizing others’ ideas in our own words while providing a proper citation

### Final Thoughts 

As Dr. Will B. Aethikle might say, “The process of scientific discovery and answering one’s own research questions is exciting because of the potential for new knowledge, but it is imperative that such advances do not come at the expense of the participants that we rely upon."

#### Stanford Prison Experiment

---the Power of Institution

Give power without insight (with interrogation), it's the prescription for abuse.

Environment is evil.

The Best mind; be prisoners and guards; do realistic arrests, degrading acitivities, humiliate them. 5, normal kids have emotional breakdown.

"They were taking this experiment too seriously."

"Nothing is easier to denounce evil doer; Nothing more difficult than understanding him."

Good people can be transformed with drugs, by experiments.
