# Discover the Science Within

## CHAPTER 1 Psychology as a Science 

Thinking Like a Researcher

#### Why Research Methods Are Important: Thinking Differently

#### Natural Flaws in Thinking

**availability heuristic** 

a mental shortcut strategy for judging the likelihood of an event or situation occurring based on how easily we can think of similar or relevant instances.

**representativeness heuristic** 

a mental shortcut strategy for determining the likelihood of an event by how much it resembles what we consider to be a “typical” example of that event.

**better-than-average effect** 

the tendency to overestimate our skills, abilities, and performance when comparing ourselves to others. 

**overconfidence phenomenon** 

the tendency to be overly confident in the correctness of our own judgments. 

**hindsight bias** 

a sense that we “knew it all along” after we learn the actual outcome. 

**confirmation bias** 

a bias in which we only look for evidence that confirms what we already believe, thereby strengthening the original belief. 

**focusing effect** 

a bias in which we emphasize some pieces of information while undervaluing other pieces. 

**introspection** 

reflecting on our own thoughts and experiences to find relevant evidence. 

**“what you see is all there is” phenomenon** 

a failure to see the limitations of our immediate experience, making it difficult to predict alternative outcomes. 

**pleasure paradox** 

when an introspective analysis regarding a positive experience results in it becoming less enjoyable. 

**belief perseverance** 

maintaining a belief despite encountering contradictory factual information; often accomplished by interpreting information in a way that does not invalidate the original belief.

#### Anecdotal Versus Scientific Evidence

Nassim Taleb

“We love the tangible, the confirmation, the palpable, the real, the visible, the concrete, the known, the seen, the vivid, the visual . . . In other words, we are naturally shallow and superficial — and we do not know it”

**law of small numbers** 

extreme outcomes are more likely when considering a small number of cases. 

**outlier** 

a case or instance that is distinct from the majority of other cases; an oddball.

#### Need for Scientific Reasoning

sabermetrics

mechanical prediction was the superior method for providing higher-quality diagnoses than clinical method

**scientific method** 

a systematic approach for addressing questions of interest.

### Goals of the Scientific Method

#### Producing Basic and Applied Research

Basic research often serves as the foundation for **applied research**, which usually has a more immediate goal of solving a practical problem or examining the real-world implications of a particular theory.

**basic research** 

research dedicated to expanding the existing knowledge on a topic. 

**applied research** 

research dedicated to solving a problem and helping people by improving their quality of life. 

#### Becoming Better Consumers of Research

**pseudoscience** 

claims or beliefs that are misrepresented as being derived from the use of the scientific method.

#### Acquiring Career Skills

#### Project Management

Researchers need to be detail-oriented, paying attention to the nuances of the study that will ensure its methodological soundness.

#### Problem Solving

#### Critical Thinking

**critical-thinking skills** 

the process of actively evaluating, applying, analyzing, and synthesizing information. 

#### Analytical Skills

#### Interpretation of Numerical Information

**infographic** 

a graphic that synthesizes statistical information with aesthetically appealing visuals.

#### Communication Skills

### Final Thoughts

Learning about research will stimulate your curiosity about the world around you. As William Butler Yeats said, “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”

## Chapter 2 The Research Process

Ideas to Innovations

### Something to Think Sbout

scientifically literate

the scientific method represents a set of general steps for systematically answering questions

“Asking questions is a good way to find things out.” 

#### The Research Question 

-  should feel a special connection to your research idea
- **empirical** in nature (an approach in which the experimenter uses direct and indirect observations or experiences to test the research question)

i.e. “What gives meaning to a person’s life?”

#### The Literature Search

**peer review** (ask sound research questions, use suitable methods to test possible answers, draw appropriate conclusions)

the process by which other scientific experts in the field review and evaluate the quality of research before it is reported in a publication.

#### Constructing a Hypothesis

**hypothesis**

an educated prediction that provides a testable explanation of a phenomenon. 

**scientific law** 

a statement based on repeated experimental observation that describes some aspect of the world

##### Weber’s law of just noticeable difference

**scientific theory** 

a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world confirmed through repeated observation and experimentation

surmise the hypothesis (guess)

#### Generating Hypotheses

Introspection

find **the exception to the rule**

a matter of degree

change the directionality

#### Evaluating Hypotheses

- a high correpondence with reality

- simple amd direct
- parsimony (parsimonious) --- extremely unwilling to spend money

##### **Occam’s razor** 

refers to the cutting away of the unnecessary; important in hypothesis development; named after William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher

-  falsifiable or refutable ---

##### **Barnum effect** (Believing sth. broad, vague is part of human instincts.)

the tendency of people to believe that general descriptions of their personality are highly accurate and tailored specifically for them. 

### Testing Your Hypothesis

choose the appropriate methods

#### Identify Key Variables

**variable**

elements that we expect to change or vary, or that can have several different values. 

**constant** 

a factor that does not change and remains consistent. 

**conceptual definition** 

defining a variable in theoretical terms. 

**operational definition** 

determining how we will use variables in our study

#### Choose a Research Design

1 ex | non-ex

##### **experimental design** 

a research method in which the experimenter controls and manipulates the independent variable, allowing the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships between the independent and dependent variables. 

**independent variable (IV)** (introduces or inputs)

the variable that influences the dependent variable. In experiments the researcher manipulates or controls this variable. In nonexperimental studies, it is the explanatory or predictor variable and is not manipulated by the researcher. 

**dependent variable (DV)** 

the variable measured in association with changes in the independent variable; the outcome or effect. In nonexperimental studies it is referred to as the criterion or response variable.

##### **nonexperimental design** 

(not sure which variable causes which;  cannot manipulate the independent variable for ethical or pragmatic reasons.)

a design in which there is no control or manipulation of the independent variable; cause-and-effect relationships between variables cannot be established; refer to the independent variable as the explanatory or predictor variable and the dependent variable as the criterion or response variable; also known as a correlational design. 

**explanatory (predictor) variable** 

a potential causal variable in nonexperimental designs; also known as a predictor variable. 

**criterion (response) variable** 

the outcome variable in nonexperimental designs; also known as a response variable. 

**levels** 

different variations of the independent variable determined by the researcher. 

2  narrow down your design choice

**between-subjects design** 

a data collection method in which each participant or subject is only assessed on the dependent variable once.

**within-subjects design** 

a data collection method in which each participant or subject is assessed on the dependent variable more than once. 

**longitudinal design** 

the collection of data on participants over a set period of time

**programmatic research** (i.e. non+exp)

a systematic and planned sequence of related studies where subsequent studies build directly on a previous study’s findings to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon. 

#### Open Science Practices

**open science** 

the practice of freely sharing our scientific work along all stages of the research process.

#### Conduct the Study

**research protocol** 

a detailed series of steps that describes the order in which to administer the study and provides a script of what the researcher should say and do. 

**script** (in research protocol)

a written set of instructions that the researcher reads to the participant while collecting data. 

**informed consent**

a part of standard ethical procedures at the beginning of a research study in which the participant learns about the expectations of the study, is told the risks and benefits of participating, and then freely makes the choice about whether he or she wants to be in the study. 

**debriefing** 

a part of standard ethical procedures at the end of a research study; contains an explanation of the purpose of the study and disclosure of deception, and gives participants a chance to ask questions

#### Analyze the Data and Draw Conclusions

the portion of an APA-style research report that provides information about how the hypotheses were tested, explaining through statistical language, narrative, and reference to tables and graphs.

**discussion** 

the portion of an APA-style research report in which the researcher interprets, explains, and applies the results of the study. Weakness

**reference page** 

the part of an APA-style research report in which referenced literary works are given credit.

#### Publish the Findings

**research journal** 

a periodical containing articles by experts in a particular field of study

The more you learn about how to conduct research yourself, the better you will be at consuming scientific information from mass media sources, and basing life choices on it. 

## Lecture 2. 0516

Scientists don't care about prescription (value, worldview), but description.

Positive is a value-laden (heavily loaded with sth.) word.

Peer Review's cons: Experts may have their paradigms. Your research may contradict with their paradigms.

Hypothesis: specfic

Scientific Law

Scientific Theory: understand the phenomena, general

## Lecture 3. 0518

operationalize the same conceptual variable

What / Why

#### C3 handout

Ethics are a set of (universal #Kant /relative) principles that people in society agree to comply with. There may be incompatibility between 2 ethical rules. Interest

In Q1's situation, equity and justice (responsibility/right) are prior to friendship. Although you may not feel comfortable reporting your friend to the professor, you should do it. If you don't report, all students may suspect each other.

Many people think of morality as something that’s personal and normative, whereas ethics is the standards of “good and bad” distinguished by a certain community or social setting... By these definitions of the terms, your *morality* would contradict the *ethics* of your community.

## Chapter 3 Ethics

Making Ethical Decisions in Research

### Something to Think About

Ideas + practical

Whether there should be limits on how far scientists can go in their pursuit of knowledge.

### What Are Ethics? 

**ethics** 

the application of moral principles to help guide one’s decisions and behavior.

How could utilitarianism (do the greatest good for the greatest number of people), altruism (helping without personal benefit) , and egoism (acting in accordance with one’s own self-interest) apply to a psychologist’s research process? 

### Important Ethical Principles---5

(Belmont Principle)

##### Principle 1: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence 

**cost-benefit analysis** 

an ethical principle of research in which a researcher weighs all the potential and known benefits against all the potential and known risks before conducting a study. 

**beneficence** 

actively promoting the welfare of others; an ethical obligation to maximize benefits in research studies. 

**nonmaleficence** 

do no harm; an ethical obligation to mitigate or eliminate risks to study participants. 

**loss of confidentiality** 

a failure to protect the privacy of individuals; a potential risk to participants. 

**anonymity** (harder to assure than confidentiality)

a guarantee in research studies that individual responses cannot be linked back to individual participants

**physical harm** 

a physical toll that study participation may have; a potential risk to participants

**psychological harm** 

a psychological toll that study participation may have such as stress, negative emotions, or loss of self-esteem; a potential risk to participants. 

**cost of not doing the research** 

considering the potential beneficial application of study findings when doing a cost- benefit analysis (stress <  develop new treatments for phobias)

##### Principle 2: Justice

**justice** 

fairness in selecting study participants and in determining which participants receive the benefits of participation and which bear the burden of risk. 

##### Principle 3: Respect for Persons 

**autonomy** 

freely making an informed decision about participation in research

**assent** 

an active affirmation of a desire to participate from a person who does not have the ability to consent themselves; consent must also be sought from the legal guardian. 

#### Ethics Through a Historical Lens

- The types of studies and techniques they were using were so new that the scientists were not able to fully consider the ramifications of their actions

- There is also an inclination to think, "Certainly, modern-day scientists know better and would never do anything like that.”

be more creative and ingenious in how we design our studies

A research should undergo an ethical review before data collection started.

### Putting Ethics Into Practice

#### Making Ethical Decisions About Your Study 

**confederate** 

an accomplice of the experimenter. 

So while we may not be able to study bullying directly, we can study social rejection, which is one component of bullying;  said nice or gossiped about them

#### Conducting Your Study Ethically 

providing an environment in which people can freely choose to participate

To ensure natural reactions from our participants, we will provide a cover story.

As a result of the deception (intentionally misleading participants in some fashion) and potential for distress, we need a thorough debriefing.

##### The Institutional Review Board IRB p248

a board that reviews the ethical merit of all the human research conducted at an institution. 

##### The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee

a board that reviews the ethical merit and research procedures for all animal research conducted within an institution and ensures research animals have proper living conditions

### Scientific Integrity

uphold a high degree of **scientific integrity****

**scientific integrity** 

a commitment to intellectual honesty and adherence to ethical principles in scientific research.

#### The Ethical Treatment of Data 

p256

#### The Ethical Presentation of Findings

Superposition of Forces ($R=$ the net force acting on a body=single force)

media outlets seeking to make a study’s findings as provocative as possible; 

when someone mislabels an axis on a figure or diagram by not starting the scale on the y-axis at zero; scale the data

**file drawer problem** 

a bias in the scientific community to only publish findings that confirm a researcher’s hypothesis

**plagiarism** 

representing others’ work or ideas as our own, or without giving proper credit. 

**paraphrase** 

summarizing others’ ideas in our own words while providing a proper citation

### Final Thoughts 

As Dr. Will B. Aethikle might say, “The process of scientific discovery and answering one’s own research questions is exciting because of the potential for new knowledge, but it is imperative that such advances do not come at the expense of the participants that we rely upon."

#### Stanford Prison Experiment

---the Power of Institution

Give power without insight (with interrogation), it's the prescription for abuse.

Environment is evil.

The Best mind; be prisoners and guards; do realistic arrests, degrading acitivities, humiliate them. 5, normal kids have emotional breakdown.

"They were taking this experiment too seriously."

"Nothing is easier to denounce evil doer; Nothing more difficult than understanding him."

Good people can be transformed with drugs, by experiments.

## CHAPTER 4 The Pyschologist's Toolbox

Tools for Building Better Designs

### Something to Think About

the basics of the research process (Chapter 2) and the ethical guidelines to follow when conducting psychological research (Chapter 3)

research question, research design, findings/answers, share/publish findings

### Choosing the Right Design for the Job

**true experiments**

designs in which the researcher manipulates all of the independent variables and randomly assigns participants to groups.

**quasi-independent variables** 

variables treated as if they were independent variables in the experimental design even though the researchers did not manipulate them. 

**quasi-experimental designs** 

designs in which the researcher cannot manipulate the independent variable or use random assignment

### Measuring Variables

For psychologists, the ability to measure psychological concepts such as love, depression, stress, anxiety, loneliness, happiness, body image, and self-esteem means that we can study strategies for improving peoples’ lives in these areas.

self-report and behavioral

#### Self-Report

any measurement technique that directly asks the participant how they think or feel. e.g. human behavior, emotion, and thought 

##### Advantages

quicker and easier

Due to the privileged position that your “self” has regarding your thoughts and feelings

##### Disadvantages

blind spots

(They would likely inflate their responses because they would have forgotten, discounted, or rationalized several instances where they were less than kind.)

**social desirability**

the tendency for respondents to give answers that make them look good. 

**demand characteristic**

a cue that potentially makes participants aware of what the experimenter expects (Don't succumb to demand characteristics!)

mix the topic we are interested in with a number of other filler items 

**retrospective bias** 

when participants view or interpret past events in an inaccurate way. 

#### Behavioral Measures 

a measure of participants’ actions in a research design

**behavioral trace** 

a behavioral measure that relies on evidence left behind by a participant who is no longer present. 

#### Determining Which Measure Is Best

utilize behavioral measures that are less prone to social desirability concerns (behavioral traces/choices)

### Types of Meansurement Error

their scores will represent their true anxiety level as well as extraneous 无关的 factors

**raw score** 

the actual score, comprised of a true score and error. 

**true score** 

what the score would be if the test were a perfect measure of the attribute being tested and were uninfluenced by any extraneous factors. 

**error** 

extraneous influences that cause the raw score to deviate from the true score. 

#### Random Error

variation from the measure’s true score due to unsystematic or chance factors.

use Statistics

#### Bias

error that *consistently* pushes scores in a given direction; also known as systematic error. 

choose data collection strategies that minimize random error and prevent the introduction of bias

### Keys to Effectice Measurement

#### Setting the Stage 

incorporate **standardization**

keeping the experimental situation the same for everyone and as free from variation as possible.

or have a large sample and take multiple measurements

#### Building the Better Measurement

**observer or scorer bias** 

misinterpreting an observation based on the researcher’s existing beliefs, previous experiences, or expectations. 

Personal definitions

many self-report measures use 5 to 9 response options

**sensitivity** 
the range of data a researcher can gather from a particular instrument

### Reliability and Validity of Measures 

**reliability** 
the stability or consistency of a measure.

**validity** 
the degree to which a tool measures what it claims to measure

### Recruiting Research  Participants 

 In either case, the overall goal is to research a relatively small set of people and apply what you learn about them to a larger group.

#### Sampling the Population

**population** 
the entire group of interest in a research study from which the researcher draws the sample

**sample** 
a subset of the population from which the researcher collects data. 

**sampling plan** 
the explicit strategy used for recruiting participants from the population. 

**representative sample**
a sample with specific features that characterize the population of interest. 

##### Types of Sampling -- probability/non-

**probability sampling**
a sampling approach in which everyone in a given population has an equal chance of selection for participation. 

**simple random sampling** 
a probability sampling method in which a subset of individuals are randomly selected from population members. 

**stratified random sampling** 
includes dividing the population into strata or subpopulations and using simple random sampling to select participants from each strata in proportion to the population at large. 

**cluster random sampling** 
dividing the total population into groups (or clusters), then using simple random sampling to select which clusters participate; all observations in a selected cluster are included in the sample. 

**non-probability sampling** 
everyone in the population does not have an equal chance of being sampled, therefore creating a bias in the sample

**convenience sampling** 
nonrandom selections of participants who are readily available to the researcher to serve as the sample. 

**quota sampling**
freely choosing any participant as long as they help meet predetermined targets for the sample’s characteristics. 

**purposive sampling** 
the researcher chooses the sample based on who they think would be appropriate or qualified for the study; used when a limited number of people have expertise in the area under investigation. 

**snowball sampling** 
existing study participants recruit future participants from among their acquaintances. 

#### Sampling Issues

maximize the generalizability of your conclusions

##### Nonresponse Bias

a potential systematic difference between those who refused to participate in a study and those who participated. 

##### The Volunteer Subject Problem 

### L5. 0525

Keeping Public Science Strong

- calling out political interference
- protecting scientists from **reprisal** and harassment
- surveying federal scientists (adherence to agency policies, scientific integrity abuses)

### L6. 0530

##### how study abroad influences students

True experiement: randomly assigned to 2 groups -> pre-test -> IV (treatment) -> DV (academic achievement)

2 groups

Self

### Informed consent form

purpose of the research, procedures, Time Duration of procedures and study, participant election, Discomfort and Risk, possible benefits, statement of confidentiality

RLM: Anonymous VS. confidential (gather IP data, when&how to destroy ) 

How do **politics and funding sources impact** the scientific integrity of research studies? What are some potential ways in which bias, censorship, limited funding, and influence on scientific institutions could compromise scientific integrity? How can researchers and scientific institutions prioritize ethical practices and transparency to mitigate these potential impacts? i.e. interest&manipulate group in school

## CHAPTER 7 Correlational Research: Is Going Greek a Great Idea

**correlational study** 
a research approach that focuses on how variables relate to one another

#### Weighing Our Options: Picking the Best Design 

Qualitative: **open-ended question** 
a question that participants answer using their own words

**closed-ended question** 
a question that participants answer using a predetermined set of response options.

**scale** 
a measurement strategy for assigning a number to represent the degree to which a person possesses or exhibits the target variable. (two different scales for our study: one that measures self-concept clarity and another that measures interest in joining a Greek organization.)

**summated ratings scale** 
a scale where a participant evaluates a series of statements using a set of predetermined response options, and the responses are summed to represent the overall measurement for the variable; commonly referred to as a Likert scale. 

**Likert scale** 
another name for a summated ratings scale. 

**survey** ( **reliability** & **validity** )
a quantitative research strategy for systematically collecting information from a group of individuals; the information is then generalized to a larger group of interest

##### Writing High-Quality Items 

Precise; no double-barrel item; no jargon

**response set** 
a response bias where a participant tends to give the same answer to most, if not all of the items on a scale, regardless of what questions are asked. 

**acquiescent 默认 response set** 
a response bias where a participant tends to agree with most, if not all, of the items on a scale, regardless of what questions are asked.

mark the items using opposite direction wording with an *asterisk*.

**forced choice scale** 
a scale where a person must choose between only two response alternatives for each item. 

**error of central tendency** 
a response bias where a participant tends to avoid using the extreme response alternatives on a scale. 

##### Calculating the Participant’s Score

**reverse-coding** 
a scoring strategy where more negative response alternatives are assigned higher numerical values and more positive response alternatives are assigned lower numerical values; used to minimize the potential for an acquiescent response set. 

#### Weighing Our Options: Is Our Scale Reliable and Valid? 

##### Reliability

**internal consistency reliability** 
the degree to which the individual items in a scale are interrelated

**test-retest reliability** 
the temporal stability of a measure. 

**correlation** 
a measure of the linear relationship between two variables; can range from −1.0 to +1.0; typically represented by the symbol *r.* 

**alternative-form reliability** 
a form of reliability that evaluates how well a measure correlates with a similar, but different, measure of the same variable. 

**equivalent-form reliability** 
another name for alternative-form reliability

##### Validity

**face validity** (-> demand characteristics / social desirability bias)
the degree to which a scale appears, on the surface, to measure the intended variable. 

**content validity** 
the degree to which the items on a scale reflect the range of material that should be included in a measurement of the target variable

**construct validity** 
the degree to which the scale actually measures the desired construct; established by evaluating the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurement. 

- **convergent validity** 
  the degree to which scores on a measurement correspond to measures of other theoretically related variables; used to help establish the construct validity of a measurement. 

- **discriminant validity** 
  the degree to which a measurement does not correspond to measures of unrelated variables; used to help establish the construct validity of a measurement. 

**criterion validity** 
the degree to which a measurement relates to a particular outcome or behavior; established by evaluating the concurrent and predictive validity of the measurement. 

**concurrent validity** 
the degree to which a measurement corresponds with an existing outcome or behavior; used to establish the criterion validity of a measurement. 

**predictive validity** 
the degree to which a measurement corresponds with a particular outcome or behavior that occurs in the future; used to establish the criterion validity of a measurement. 

##### Pilot Testing

#### Our Hypothesis

**nondirectional hypothesis** 
a hypothesis that does not make a specific prediction as to how two variables are related. 

**directional hypothesis** 
a hypothesis that makes a specific prediction as to the exact nature of the relationship between two variables.

#### Weighing Our Options: Picking a Design for Our Research Questions

**behavioral diary** 
a self-report data collection strategy where individuals record their behaviors and associated feelings as they occur. 

**pretest-posttest design** 
a within-subjects design where participants are measured before and after exposure to a treatment or intervention (**baseline measurement**)

**repeated-measures design** 
a within-subjects design where participants are exposed to each level of the independent variable and are measured on the dependent variable after each level; unlike the pretest-posttest design, there is no baseline measurement.

#### Literature review

##### Flow in Games 

Csikszentmihalyi’s research and personal observations identified eight major components of Flow: 

• A challenging activity requiring skill; 

• A merging of action and awareness; 

• Clear goals; 

• Direct, immediate feedback; 

• Concentration on the task at hand; 

• A sense of control; 

• A loss of self-consciousness; and 

• An altered sense of time.
