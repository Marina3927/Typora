how stories can distract us from thinking critically to make harmfully distorted representations seem natural and true

Tobias Wolff puts it in his [*Paris Review* interview](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5391/the-art-of-fiction-no-183-tobias-wolff):
And the most radical political writing of all is that which makes you aware of the reality of another human being. Self-absorbed as we are, self-imprisoned even, we don’t feel that often enough. Most of the spiritualities we’ve evolved are designed to deliver us from that lockup, and art is another way out. Good stories slip past our defenses—we all want to know what happens next—and then slow time down, and compel our interest and belief in other lives than our own, so that we feel ourselves in another presence. It’s a kind of awakening, a deliverance, it cracks our shell and opens us up to the truth and singularity of others—to their very being. Writers who can make others, even our enemies, real to us have achieved a profound political end, whether or not they would call it that.

Keene’s “Counternarratives” (and “Encounternarratives,” accounting for about half of the collection) themselves are often about competing, stratified orders... Not only new, but needed: these stories help restore agency, depth, and dignity to figures formerly denied full representation—
