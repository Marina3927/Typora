When you need to be explicit, type * (Shift + 8) to insert the multiplication operator. You will see a multiplication dot (⋅) appear in the answer box. Do not use the symbol ××. For example, for the expression ma, typing m ⋅ a would be correct, but mxa would be incorrect

When numbers are multiplied or divided, the result can have no more significant figures than the factor with the **fewest significant figures** has. For example, 3.1416 * 2.34 * 0.58 = 4.3.

(2 significant figures)

When we add and subtract numbers, it’s the location of the **decimal point** that matters, not the number of significant figures. For example, 123.62 + 8.9 = 132.5.

At the atomic scale, contact forces are field forces.

#### inertia

the tendency of a body to keep moving once it is set in motion

equilibruim

#### **inertial** frame of reference,  *law of inertia.*

#### Second Law

**One newton is the amount of net force that gives an acceleration of 1 meter per second squared to a body with a mass of 1 kilogram.**

The forces that affect a body’s motion are *external* forces

 If a net external force acts on a body, the body accelerates. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force. The mass of the body times the acceleration vector of the body equals the net force vector.

Because of its rotation and orbital motion the earth is not precisely inertial.

### Sl-Linear Fit

n ndependent measurements of a physical quantity X

#### confidence 95%

https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/confidence-interval/

To describe probability. if you construct a confidence interval with a 95% confidence level, you are confident that 95 out of 100 times the estimate will fall between the upper and lower values specified by the confidence interval.

The **confidence interval** is *the range of values* that you expect your estimate to fall between a certain percentage of the time if you run your experiment again or re-sample the population in the same way.

The **confidence level** is *the percentage of times* you expect to reproduce an estimate between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval, and is set by the alpha value.

Confidence $=1-\alpha $

The *p* value, or probability value, tells you the statistical significance of a finding. In most studies, a *p* value of 0.05 or less is considered statistically significant, but this threshold can also be set higher or lower.

if you use an alpha value of *p* < 0.05 for statistical significance, then your confidence level would be 1 − 0.05 = 0.95, or 95%.

### e4 -- 3 methods of measuring the speed of sound in air

1. What is a longitudinal/transverse wave? Are sound waves longitudinal or transverse?

A  longitudinal wave is a wave in which the particles of the medium move *parallel* to the direction of wave propagation.

 A transverse wave is a wave in which the particles of the medium move *perpendicular* to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves are longitudinal waves.

2. What parameter of a compressible medium does determine the speed of sound in that medium? What is the magnitude of the speed of sound in air/water/steel?

The speed of sound in a compressible medium is determined by ***the medium's density and elasticity***. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second. In water, the speed of sound is approximately 1482 meters per second. In steel, the speed of sound is approximately 5960 meters per second.

3. What is the phase speed?

The phase speed of a wave is the speed at which ***the phase of the wave propagates***. (Transmit through a particular direction) It is related to the frequency and wavelength of the wave by the equation phase speed = frequency x wavelength.

4. What is the wavefront?

A wavefront is a surface of constant phase in a wave. It is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and represents the position of the wave at a given instant in time.

5. Briefly describe the idea of at least one measurement method.

Resonance Method: standing waves will form when the distance between S1 and S2 is a multiple of half-wavelength

6. What are standing waves on a string? When can a standing wave of length *λ* form on a string of length *L* clamped at both ends?

Standing waves on a string are waves that do not propagate through the medium, but instead ***oscillate*** in place. When a standing wave of length λ can form on a string of length L clamped at both ends, the wavelength of the standing wave must be equal to twice the length of the string divided by an integer, or λ = 2L/n, where n is an integer.

In a wave that travels along the string, the amplitude is constant and the wave pattern moves with a speed equal to the wave speed. Here, instead, the wave pattern remains in the same position along the string and its amplitude fluctuates. it has nodes that never move at all.

7. What are the Lissajous figures? Sketch the Lissajous figures for the system of parametric equations *x* = sin(*ωt* + *δ*) and *y* = sin *ωt*, with *δ* = 0*, π/*4*, π/*2*, π*. 

Lissajous figures are patterns that are created by plotting the motion of two perpendicular harmonic oscillators against each other. The figures are named after Jules Antoine Lissajous, a French physicist who studied the phenomenon in the 19th century. The figures are characterized by their shape, which depends on the frequency and phase difference between the two oscillators.

8. What is the ’CURSOR’ function on the oscilloscope used for?

The 'CURSOR' function on an oscilloscope is used to measure the values of different points on a waveform. It allows the user to place two cursors on the screen and measure the time and voltage difference between them. This can be useful for measuring the frequency, period, amplitude, and phase of a waveform.
