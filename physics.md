About centipetral acceleration: 

1. The centripetal acceleration is simply the acceleration of a particle going around in a circle.
2. It has magnitude of either $v^2/R$ or $ω^2R$.
3. It is directed radially inward.

Zero acceleration <--> net force = 0

In the absence of gravity, the tension in a stationary rope may be taken to be constant.

magnitude has no sign.

#### Second Law

**One newton is the amount of net force that gives an acceleration of 1 meter per second squared to a body with a mass of 1 kilogram.**

The forces that affect a body’s motion are *external* forces

 If a net external force acts on a body, the body accelerates. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force. The mass of the body times the acceleration vector of the body equals the net force vector.

Because of its rotation and orbital motion the earth is not precisely inertial.

### Sl-Linear Fit

n ndependent measurements of a physical quantity X

#### confidence 95%

https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/confidence-interval/

To describe probability. if you construct a confidence interval with a 95% confidence level, you are confident that 95 out of 100 times the estimate will fall between the upper and lower values specified by the confidence interval.

The **confidence interval** is *the range of values* that you expect your estimate to fall between a certain percentage of the time if you run your experiment again or re-sample the population in the same way.

The **confidence level** is *the percentage of times* you expect to reproduce an estimate between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval, and is set by the alpha value.

Confidence $=1-\alpha $

The *p* value, or probability value, tells you the statistical significance of a finding. In most studies, a *p* value of 0.05 or less is considered statistically significant, but this threshold can also be set higher or lower.

if you use an alpha value of *p* < 0.05 for statistical significance, then your confidence level would be 1 − 0.05 = 0.95, or 95%.

### e3 -- Simple Harmonic Motion: Oscillations in Mechanical Systems

- State the Hooke’s law. When is it applicable?

F = -kx, where F is the force applied, x is the displacement from the equilibrium position, and k is the spring constant.

Hooke's law is applicable to any elastic material. It's only valid within the elastic limit of the material.

- Give an example of a harmonic oscillator other than the mass–spring system.

Pendulum $d^2θ/dt^2 + (g/L)sin(θ) = 0$ , a simple harmonic wave on a string, the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field, and the motion of a simple harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics.

- Does the period of oscillations depend on initial conditions? No.

- Is motion of a simple pendulum an example of simple harmonic motion? Explain. Yes.

- Sketch the graphs *x* = *x*(*t*), *vx* = *vx*(*t*), and *ax* = *ax*(*t*) for a particle moving in simple harmonic motion.

$$
m d^2x/dt^2 + kx = 0\\
x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ)\\
\text{where A is the amplitude of the oscillation} \\ \text{ω is the angular frequency of the oscillation}\\ \text{and φ is the phase angle.}
$$



Sketch the graphs *K* = *K*(*t*) ***kinetic energy*** and *U* = *U*(*t*) ***potential energy*** for a particle moving in simple harmonic motion.

Mass-spring system
$$
K = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)mω^2A^2sin^2(ωt + φ)\\
U = (1/2)kx^2 = (1/2)kA^2cos^2(ωt + φ)
$$

- Will the oscillation period change when the inclination angle of the air track is changed? Explain. No

The oscillation period depends solely on the physical properties of the system, such as the mass, spring constant, and length of the pendulum. 

It may affect the amplitude and displacement of the oscillation, as well as the forces acting on the system. It is important to note that the motion of the system may no longer be strictly one-dimensional if the air track is inclined, which may require a more complex analysis of the system.

- How to check whether the Jolly balance is vertical?

Jolly balance, device, now largely obsolete, for determining the specific gravity (relative density) of solids and liquids.

Mass: how much the spring lengthens when the object is resting in the upper pan in air (w![w](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/88b1e0c8e1be5ebe69d18a8010676fa42d7961e6)), and then when the object is moved to the lower pan and immersed in water (w′).

$\frac w {(w-w')}$

### e4 -- 3 methods of measuring the speed of sound in air

1. What is a longitudinal/transverse wave? Are sound waves longitudinal or transverse?

A  longitudinal wave is a wave in which the particles of the medium move *parallel* to the direction of wave propagation.

 A transverse wave is a wave in which the particles of the medium move *perpendicular* to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves are longitudinal waves.

2. What parameter of a compressible medium does determine the speed of sound in that medium? What is the magnitude of the speed of sound in air/water/steel?

The speed of sound in a compressible medium is determined by ***the medium's density and elasticity***. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second. In water, the speed of sound is approximately 1482 meters per second. In steel, the speed of sound is approximately 5960 meters per second.

3. What is the phase speed?

The phase speed of a wave is the speed at which ***the phase of the wave propagates***. (Transmit through a particular direction) It is related to the frequency and wavelength of the wave by the equation phase speed = frequency x wavelength.

4. What is the wavefront?

A wavefront is a surface of constant phase in a wave. It is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and represents the position of the wave at a given instant in time.

5. Briefly describe the idea of at least one measurement method.

Resonance Method: standing waves will form when the distance between S1 and S2 is a multiple of half-wavelength

6. What are standing waves on a string? When can a standing wave of length *λ* form on a string of length *L* clamped at both ends?

Standing waves on a string are waves that do not propagate through the medium, but instead ***oscillate*** in place. When a standing wave of length λ can form on a string of length L clamped at both ends, the wavelength of the standing wave must be equal to twice the length of the string divided by an integer, or λ = 2L/n, where n is an integer.

In a wave that travels along the string, the amplitude is constant and the wave pattern moves with a speed equal to the wave speed. Here, instead, the wave pattern remains in the same position along the string and its amplitude fluctuates. it has nodes that never move at all.

7. What are the Lissajous figures? Sketch the Lissajous figures for the system of parametric equations *x* = sin(*ωt* + *δ*) and *y* = sin *ωt*, with *δ* = 0*, π/*4*, π/*2*, π*. 

Lissajous figures are patterns that are created by plotting the motion of two perpendicular harmonic oscillators against each other. The figures are named after Jules Antoine Lissajous, a French physicist who studied the phenomenon in the 19th century. The figures are characterized by their shape, which depends on the frequency and phase difference between the two oscillators.

8. What is the ’CURSOR’ function on the oscilloscope used for?

The 'CURSOR' function on an oscilloscope is used to measure the values of different points on a waveform. It allows the user to place two cursors on the screen and measure the time and voltage difference between them. This can be useful for measuring the frequency, period, amplitude, and phase of a waveform.

### e5

1. What is the effect of damping on the amplitude and the frequency of non-driven oscillations?

Damping causes the amplitude of an oscillation to decrease over time. The frequency of a damped oscillator is less than the natural frequency of the system. The natural frequency is the frequency at which an object vibrates when it is disturbed. The resonance frequency is the frequency at which an object vibrates with maximum amplitude when it is disturbed. The resonance frequency is greater than the natural frequency of the system.

3. Sketch the time dependence of the displacement from the equilibrium position for a harmonic oscillator in the (a) underdamped, (b) overdamped regime.

4. What is the phase difference between the displacement and a sinusoidal driving force if (a) the system is at resonance, (b) the frequency of the driving force is much larger than the natural frequency of the system.

   resonance occurs when an external force matches an object’s natural frequency, causing it to vibrate with maximum amplitude.

5. Is there any relation between the resonance frequency and the natural frequency? Explain briefly.

6. Give an example of an application of mechanical resonance.

7. Sketch the curves *θ*st vs. *ω* for steady-state driven oscillations with two different damping coefficients *β*1 *< β*2. Label the curves with *β*1 and *β*2 accordingly.

8. Sketch the curves *ϕ* vs. *ω* for steady-state driven oscillations with two difffferent damping coeffiffifficients *β*1 *< β*2. Label the curves with *β*1 and *β*2 accordingly.c
