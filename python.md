Also you can start an HTTP server to interactively browse documentation by typing `python -m pydoc -b` (python 3)



```zsh
# interactive mode: Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
python3

# direct search: do not have to import a module to look at its help text
python -m pydoc list.append
```
